- cleanup the mess with exec() and os_cmd
- get_env(:app_id) seems wrong - needs to be configured in two places?
- make firmware_valid? work as a plugin
- why do we have to use such a specific version of fw_json?
- uploading firmware is 100% tied to cowboy webserver right now
- cowboy is not a plugin at all, but should be, absolutely!
